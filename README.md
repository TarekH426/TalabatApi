# TalabatApi
Talabat E-Commerce Web API (.NET 8, C# 12)

A modular, scalable e-commerce Web API built with ASP.NET Core (.NET 8). This project provides endpoints for product management, user authentication, shopping basket operations, and caching. It uses Entity Framework Core for data access, JWT for secure authentication, and Redis for distributed caching. The architecture follows best practices with dependency injection, AutoMapper for object mapping, and a clean separation of concerns across services, repositories, and data contexts. Swagger is enabled for easy API documentation and testing.
Features:
•	Product and category management
•	User registration, login, and JWT authentication
•	Shopping basket with Redis caching
•	Custom error handling middleware
•	AutoMapper for DTO mapping
•	Swagger/OpenAPI support
